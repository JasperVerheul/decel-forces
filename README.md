# Horizontal deceleration forces

## Summary
This respository contains the dataset used for [Verheul et al (2024)](link). This dataset includes kinematics and kinetics at different levels of the musculoskeletal system during horizontal decelerations, including:
+ ground reaction forces (anteroposterior, mediolateral, vertical)
+ joint angles (ankle, knee, hip)
+ segment centre of mass positions (full body)
+ joint moments (full body) 
+ joint contact forces (ankle, knee, hip) 
+ muscle and tendon lenghts (96 musculotendons)
+ muscle and tendon forces (96 musculotendons)

The dataset and processing methods are described in more detail in our [Journal of ... publication](https://).
