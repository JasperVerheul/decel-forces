# Horizontal deceleration forces

## Summary
This respository contains a full dataset of forces experienced at different levels of the musculoskeletal system during horizontal decelerations from sprinting. The markers of biomechanical load in this dataset include:
+ ground reaction forces (anteroposterior, mediolateral, vertical)
+ joint moments (ankle, knee, hip) 
+ joint contact forces (ankle, knee, hip) 
+ muscle forces (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus, tibialis anterior)
+ tendon forces (patellar, Achilles)

The dataset and processing methods are described in more detail in our [Journal of ... publication](https://).
