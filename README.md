# Horizontal deceleration forces

## Summary
This respository contains the dataset used for [Verheul et al (2024)](link). This dataset contains full-body kinematics and kinetics at different levels of the musculoskeletal system during horizontal decelerations, including:
+ ground reaction forces (anteroposterior, mediolateral, vertical)
+ joint angles (full body)
+ segment centre of mass positions (full body)
+ joint moments (full body) 
+ joint contact forces (ankle, medial/lateral knee, hip) 
+ muscle and tendon lenghts (80 lower-limb musculotendons)
+ muscle and tendon forces (80 lower-limb musculotendons)
+ athlete-specific model information

The dataset and processing methods are described in more detail in [Verheul et al (2024)](https://).
