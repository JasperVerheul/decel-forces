# Horizontal deceleration forces

## Summary
This respository contains the dataset used and described in [Verheul et al (2024)](link). This dataset contains full-body kinematics and kinetics at different levels of the musculoskeletal system during horizontal decelerations, including:
+ ground reaction forces (anteroposterior, mediolateral, vertical)
+ joint angles (ankle, knee, hip)
+ joint moments (ankle, knee, hip) 
+ joint contact forces (ankle, medial/lateral knee, hip) 
+ muscle forces and lenghts (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus, tibialis anterior)
+ tendon forces (patellar, Achilles)
+ athlete-specific model information (incl. height, mass)

The dataset and processing methods are described in more detail in [Verheul et al (2024)](https://).
